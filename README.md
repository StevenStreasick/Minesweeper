# Minesweeper
Using Roblox Studio's version of Lua, I created the classic game Minesweeper. I wanted to create this project to focus on two main concepts. I planned to expand my programming skills by learning Object Oriented Programming (OOP) within a non object oriented language and I wanted to improve my readability witihn my code by practicing never nesting concepts. Roblox's Lua-U is considered to support Prototype based programming, meaning it can implement a style of OOP, but not without a few hiccups along the way. 

This project started out as a fun week long project where I intended to code Minesweeper on Roblox. Along the way, I scaled this project to be much larger. Currently, I am in the process of implementing a three dimensional version of minesweeper and I have plans to design my own version of Minesweeper in the style of the hit game 2048. In addition to this, I am currently in the process of planning more unique versions of Minesweeper.
