# Minesweeper
Using Roblox Studio's version of Lua, I created the classic game Minesweeper. I wanted to create this project to focus on two main concepts - OOP within a functional programming language and Never Nesting concepts - the idea that you should avoid having many embedded nests, or indendations, within your program.

I designed certain aspects of this program with the plan to eventually revisit this program and add new versions of Minesweeper to my game. I planned to add a three dimensional version of minesweeper, and I also designed my own version of Minesweeper in the style of the hit game 2048.
